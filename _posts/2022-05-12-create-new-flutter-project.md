If you insist on using Android Studio to create your project, you may encounter this problem (especially if you are using an old version of Android Studio):

You installed Flutter, Android Studio and within it the Dart and Flutter plugins, and even then, when you restart the IDE, the option to create a new Flutter project does not appear.

Usually, the problem is that `Android APK Support` plugin is disabled and enabling it should resolve the problem.

Try this:

1. On `Configure -> Plugins` check if:

   a. `Dart` and `Flutter` plugins are checked as enabled.

   b. `Android APK Support` is checked as enabled.

2. Restart Android Studio.

If still is not there, remove and reinstall `Dart` and `Flutter` plugins.
