Hi, I’m João Nogueira — a Flutter developer with over five years of experience building cross-platform applications that blend clean architecture, usability, and real-world impact. I specialize in mobile, web, and desktop development using Flutter, with a strong focus on automated testing, CI/CD pipelines, and scalable API integrations.

Throughout my career, I’ve led technical initiatives in SaaS environments, including document management systems and industrial safety platforms used by thousands of users across national and international companies. My background in biology and environmental education taught me how to approach problems with curiosity, depth, and empathy — qualities I bring into every line of code I write.

I’m passionate about continuous learning, collaborative teams, and delivering meaningful solutions. I thrive in agile squads, enjoy contributing to technical decisions, and believe in balancing engineering excellence with product value. On this blog, I share insights, experiments, and lessons learned from my journey with Flutter, software architecture, and development best practices — always with the goal of learning together and building things that matter.
